# Greetings!

I'm HG, or Ian, or ハグ to some.

I am...
- a Software Engineer, experienced in designing mobile games and applications for SteamVR and HoloLens 2 in both Unity and Unreal (mostly Unity).
- a Translator, experienced in translating from Japanese to English for games, tourism, subtitles, and screenplays for large companies.
- a Video Producer, experienced in the usage of Premiere Pro and After Effects
- an amateur musician, having played piano and violin
- American diaspora of mixed Irish heritage

I aspire to create novel methods of systems monitoring, storytelling, and collaborative entertainment in AR/VR.
